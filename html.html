ASSIGNMENT TOPIC
You are building a Barbers' Shop website. 
The website is quite simple, it should include the basic information about the Shop (Name, address etc)

        Add a navbar with the links to the sections

​
    <!-- EXERCISE 3:
            Write the main title of the barber shop and a smaller claim.
        -->
<h1 class="h1"> Barber Aleks Shop</h1>
<p class="p">The best Barber shop you will find in town.
    Have you ever sat in a barber’s chair and wondered what it was like to be on the other
     side? Do you walk past a red, white, and blue barber pole and think about what it would be like
      work in a barbershop? Barbering isn’t your typical day job. It’s creative, it’s fast-paced, and
       it makes your clients feel rock-solid awesome. If you’ve ever considered a career in barbering,
        you’re not alone!
</p>


​
    <!-- EXERCISE 4: 
            Write a section in which you explain a current promotion
        -->

<p1 class="p1"><img id="photo" src="photo.jpg"    ></p1>
<p class="p" font-size="100px">
    1. BARBERING IS NOT A NINE-TO-FIVE JOB
    Does the idea of sitting at a desk all day stress you out? Do you cringe at the thought of clacking away at a 
    computer or pushing paper around an office? Then barbering may be just the career for you. You work with clients
     in a creative environment, and no two days in a barbershop are ever the same.<br>            
   
     2. YOU CAN EXPRESS YOUR FLAIR FOR CREATIVITY
    The barbershop is a creative environment. There are always new styles and techniques to learn. 
    You can even invent some yourself. Do you want to try a new fade? Work on your beard styling skills? 
    Let your creative side shine!.<br>  
    
    3. BARBERS CAN BE SOCIAL
    You won’t be stuck in a cubicle all by yourself. Making good conversation as a Barber is part of the job. 
    It makes the time fly faster for both you and your clients, and it’s just great customer service. By getting 
    to know your clients, you make yourself feel more like their friend than just someone they pay for a service. 
    This means they’re more likely to come back to you, and not another barber..<br>  
     
    4. YOU HAVE FLEXIBILITY AS A BARBER
    Many barbers are self-employed, which means they can set their own hours. Self-employed barbers also
     handle their own marketing and set their own rates. If you work on commission, you won’t have as much 
     flexibility with your time, but you also won’t have to worry about marketing or scheduling appointments—someone 
     else will take care of that for you, so you have more time to focus on barbering..<br>
